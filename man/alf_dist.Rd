\title{Compute probability distribution tables}
\usage{
alf_dist(j, in_dir, out_dir, period, reps, project = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{j}{integer, iterator, the sequence of unique geographic regions available among the extracted data.}

\item{in_dir}{input directory where extracted data are located in .rds files.}

\item{out_dir}{output directory where random variables distribution tables are saved as .rds files.}

\item{period}{character, \code{"historical"} or \code{"projected"}.}

\item{reps}{integer vector, simulation replicates included in data extraction, e.g., \code{1:200}. Uses all replicates if not provided.}

\item{project}{character, inferred from \code{in_dir} if \code{project = NULL}. Use this for project with subprojects/treatment group Alfresco runs.}
}
\description{
Compute and save to disk probability distributions of random variables from extracted ALFRESCO outputs.
}
\details{
This function estimates discrete probability distributions of random variables from extracted ALFRESCO
model runs. The random variables available include fire size, burn area and fire frequency by vegetation class, as
well as cover area and age for a vegetation class.

This function estimates probability distributions for outputs from \link{run_alf_extraction}.
