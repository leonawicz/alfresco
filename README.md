R is used to manipulate and analyze data that both feed into and come out of the ALFRESCO wildfire model. The `alfresco` R package contains functions for working with ALFRESCO input and output data. It is a core functional package in the [SNAPverse](https://leonawicz.github.io/snapverse/) collection of R packages.

Features
--------

The `alfresco` package includes functions that assist with the following analyses and processing pipelines:

-   Fire events processing immediately following ALFRESCO runs
-   Post-ALFRESCO run, automated Shiny app creation.
-   Hierarchical data extractions from ALFRESCO run output geotiff map sets.
-   Calculations for burn area ratios across multiple ALFRESCO run scenarios.
-   Copying and organizing subsets of ALFRESCO outputs for consecutive model runs and in preparation for other analyses.
-   Generating fire management options ratios geotiffs and related graphics.
-   Generation of flexible bash and slurm scripts for processing catering to unique analysis and data processing needs.
-   Data extraction and statistics by Fire Management Options (FMO) zones.
-   Quickly access Alaska wildfire-related data sets like historical fire perimeters from the cloud.

This is a subset of eventual functionality. The package is under active development.
